# AngularJS Message Board

## Description
I plan for this to be a basic message board, with user stories as given in an Epicodus [course assignment](https://www.learnhowtoprogram.com/android/data-persistence/discussion-forum-two-day-project).

### User Stories
#### A user can...
* Post messages
* Browse messages under specified categories
* Create categories, if they don't exist
* Click messages to see additional message details
* Comment and/or reply to original messages

### Additional user stories
#### A user can...
* Upvote/downvote messages
* Reply to comments/replies (as opposed to original messages)

## Technologies
* [AngularJS](https://docs.angularjs.org/guide)
* [ui-router](https://ui-router.github.io/ng1/)
* Node.js

## Approach
* Modular, feature-based file structure
* Following [John Papa's style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/blob/master/a1/README.md), wherever possible
